# MSIC Staking

All of the revenue the protocol makes is diverted to MSIC stakers. By staking MSIC you are entitled to a pro-rata share of it.

### How does staking work in Mosaic?

To start staking all you need to do is deposit your MSIC token to the Mosaic staking contract. Once done you will start earning a pro rata share of the borrowing and redemption fees in MEUR and REEF.

### How much will my staked MSIC earn?

Your MSIC stake will earn a share of the fees equal to your share of the total MSIC staked, at the instant the fee occurred.

### Is there a lock-up period?

No, you can withdraw your staked funds at any time.

### Can I stake MEUR?

You can only stake MSIC tokens. MEUR can be deposited into the [Stability Pool](stability-pool-and-liquidations.md#what-is-the-stability-pool) instead.

### Are staked MSIC tokens used to backstop the system or for governance?

No, staked MSIC are not used to backstop the Mosaic system and are not used for governance as there is no Mosaic governance.
