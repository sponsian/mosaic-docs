# MSIC Rewards and Distribution

### What is MSIC?

MSIC is the secondary token issued by the Mosaic protocol. It captures the fee revenue that is generated by the system and incentivizes early adopters.

MSIC rewards will accrue to Stability Providers — i.e. users who deposit MEUR to the Stability Pool.

_As technical rewards, they are based on a preprogrammed functionality of the protocol and not on a claim towards any company or third party._

### What is MSIC's max supply?

MSIC has a max supply of 100,000,000 tokens.

### Is MSIC a governance token?

No. MSIC is not a governance token, as there is no Mosaic governance.

### How can I earn MSIC?

MSIC is earned by depositing MEUR into the [Stability Pool](stability-pool-and-liquidations.md#what-is-the-stability-pool).

### What can I do with MSIC?

MSIC holders can stake their tokens to earn the fees generated by loan issuance and MEUR [redemptions](meur-redemptions.md#what-are-redemptions). Learn more about [staking](staking.md).

### Was there an MSIC airdrop?

No. MSIC can only be earned by the methods mentioned above.
