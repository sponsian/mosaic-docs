# Official Mosaic Documentation

Mosaic is a decentralized borrowing protocol built on Reef Chain that allows you to draw [interest-free](faq/borrowing.md#how-can-the-protocol-offer-interest-free-borrowing) loans against REEF used as [collateral](faq/borrowing.md#what-do-you-mean-by-collateral). Loans are paid out in MEUR (a Euro pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a [minimum collateral ratio](faq/borrowing.md#what-is-the-minimum-collateral-ratio-mcr-and-the-recommended-collateral-ratio) of 110%.

In addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing MEUR and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort. Learn more about these mechanisms in our documentation.

Mosaic as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable, and governance-free.
